      <article>
        <p>This is a small instructional website for participants in Meter, a
        study being conducted by the <a
          href="http://idl.cornell.edu">Interaction Design Lab</a>.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this research is to design and evaluate novel
        measures for the self-report of pain. These measures are intended to be
        deployed on mobile devices as part of electronic diaries. We anticipate
        this research resulting in an effective measurement tool that can be
        used to support the daily experience of pain, as well as contributions
        to the fields of human-computer interaction and psychometrics.</p>
        <p>We have developed several prototypes for such self-report measures
        of pain. As a participant in this stage of the research study, we will
        ask you to participate in a 3 week field trial of the measures.</p>
        <p>Participation will mean installing two applications onto an Android
        phone. You will enroll in 2 surveys in the Ohmage application; each day
        of the study, you will complete each survey. Each survey consists of 4
        questions; we anticipate each survey taking you 1-3 minutes to complete
        each day.</p>
        <p>Set-up should take about 10 minutes. Thank you for your
        participation!</p>

      <aside>5. Set up reminders</aside>
      <article>
        <p>This is the final part of setup! We will set two reminders in
        Ohmage, one for each of the mini surveys in the Meter study. Again open
        the 'projects' tab, and select the 'Meter study' you just joined. In
        the top right-hand corner, tap on the 'bell' icon to get to
        Reminders.</p>
        <p>Tap the plus '+' icon, and set up a time reminder for the Meter
        survey part 1/2, for any time in the morning that works for you.</p>
        <p>Tap the plus '+' icon again to set up a time reminder for the second
        survey, for any time in the evening that fits your schedule.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Each day of the study, please complete both surveys, one in the
        morning and the other in the evening. The reminders you have set up
        will help by providing notifications, but <strong>you can also fill out
        a survey from the 'Surveys' tab in Ohmage</strong>.</p>
        <p>The study lasts three weeks. The following video shows an example of
        completing one of the (short!) Meter surveys. Thank you for your
        participation!</p>
